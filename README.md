## 🤖 n8n Automation Workflows

This repository contains various **automation workflows** developed on the [n8n](https://n8n.io) platform.  
The goal is to automate repetitive tasks, integrate API services, and improve processes with a low-code approach.

## 📦 Contents
- 📬 Telegram AI Customer Service
- 📋 HR Application Assessment Automation

## 🧩 Requirements
You can use the workflows by importing the `.json` files into your [n8n](https://n8n.io) instance via the **Import File** option, and configuring the required API connections.
